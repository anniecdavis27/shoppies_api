# Project Description

This is the API to Shoppies, a web application that searches for movies from OMDB and can be nominated for the Annual Shoppies Awards. Nominated movies can be saved and deleted from the API database. (Note: Shoppies Awards are actually for ecommerce businesses, but for the sake of this internship application project, I am using movies.)
